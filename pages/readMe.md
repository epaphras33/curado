​

DISCLAIMERS – HEALTHCARE SERVICES
The MeMD® Service does not provide health care services; the MeMD® Service simply provides a system to facilitate communication with the Providers using MeMD’s® owned or licensed health information database and software. MeMD® verifies the state and national (NPI, DEA) licensing status for all MeMD®-contracted Providers; however, it is your obligation to verify the state and national (NPI, DEA) licensing status for all Providers who are not contracted by MeMD®. Such Providers may include, but are not limited to, Providers whose services are offered to you as part of a subscription or bundled services package by your employer, health plan, physician, or on the MeMD® website or hosted portal.

 

MeMD® SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY PROVIDER PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE OR ADVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PRESCRIBING MEDICATIONS) THROUGH THE MeMD® SERVICE.

 

MeMD® FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY (INCLUDING ANY LIABILITY FOR A REFUND) FOR THE FAILURE OF A NON-CONTRACTED PROVIDER TO RENDER CARE TO YOU OR OTHERWISE FULFILL THE TERMS OF SERVICE OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR BUNDLED SERVICES PACKAGE. A NON-CONTRACTED PROVIDER IS A PROVIDER NOT DIRECTLY CREDENTIALED AND CONTRACTED BY MeMD® BUT WHOSE SERVICES MAY BE OFFERED TO YOU AS PART OF A SUBSCRIPTION OR BUNDLED SERVICES PACKAGE BY YOUR EMPLOYER, HEALTH PLAN, PHYSICIAN, OR ON THE MeMD® WEBSITE OR HOSTED PORTAL. MeMD® IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING YOU ADDITIONAL SERVICES PURCHASED VIA A SUBSCRIPTION OR BUNDLED SERVICES PACKAGE.

 

The MeMD® Service is not a replacement for your primary care physician or annual office check-ups, nor is it a replacement for other treating providers (except in the context of mental and behavioral health services or in the Virtual Primary Care service line where the Provider has explicitly agreed to assume such role). Consultations through the MeMD® Service treat the majority of common medical and behavioral health conditions, however a small number of cases require an in-person visit for complete care. With respect to psychotherapy and counseling, you understand that information discussed in any sessions is for therapeutic purposes only and is not intended for use in any legal proceedings involving any other individuals participating in any sessions. You agree not to subpoena any Provider to testify for or against individuals (including you) participating in the sessions or to provide records in court actions against other individuals participating in any sessions. You understand that anything any individual participating in any session tells a Provider individually, whether on the phone or otherwise, may at the Provider’s discretion be shared with any other individual participating in the sessions.

 

The MeMD® Service is not an online pharmacy, nor is it a Medicare prescription drug plan. Providers using the MeMD® Service do not, via the MeMD® Service, prescribe elective medications (except through the Men’s Health and Women’s Health service lines or the Virtual Primary Care service line when deemed by the Provider to be medically necessary), anticonvulsants (except through the Virtual Primary Care service line when deemed by the Provider to be medically necessary), narcotic pain relievers, or drugs listed as controlled substances by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency or regulated under state law. Review the DEA Controlled Substances Schedule (http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/index.html) if you are interested in a particular prescription and are uncertain if it is listed as a controlled substance. MeMD® does not guarantee that a specific medication will be prescribed by a Provider if requested, particularly where prescribing of the medication is in violation of MeMD’s® Treatment Policies or not medically appropriate, as determined by the Provider in the Provider’s sole discretion. Our behavioral health Providers will not prescribe you medication until conducting a mental health assessment (also sometimes called an intake or initial assessment) of you. You will not be prescribed more than a 90-day supply of medication at one time by a behavioral health Provider, and may not receive a refill of the medication unless you first complete a medication management visit with the behavioral health Provider. Our Providers in the Urgent Care service line generally do not prescribe more than a 90-day refill within a 6-month period; however, our Providers within the Men’s Health and Women’s Health service lines may be able to prescribe you up to a 1-year supply of medically necessary maintenance medications if you can supply adequate proof of your most recent wellness or physical exam completed within the immediately preceding year. Our Providers in the Virtual Primary Care service line may be able to prescribe you up to a 1-year supply of medically necessary maintenance medications as long as you are compliant with their recommended treatment plan. You agree that any prescription obtained from a Provider in connection with your use of the MeMD® Service will only be for its intended use. Refunds for completed visits are not provided solely on the basis of Providers not prescribing a medication.

 

The MeMD® Service does not meet the minimum essential coverage (MEC) requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or any minimum creditable coverage (MCC) requirements imposed by any state laws. The MeMD® Service is not a Qualified Health Plan under the PPACA.

 

The MeMD® Service is not insurance and is not intended to replace health insurance; it is a telemedicine service available on a per-visit or membership basis. The offering of products and services by MeMD® is not to be construed as the sale of insurance product(s) or otherwise engaging in the transaction of insurance. MeMD® expressly reserves the right, in order to comply with state insurance laws, to (i) limit the number of visits offered in connection with any bundled services and subscription packages and/or (ii) charge a visit fee, both in an amount determined by MeMD® in its sole discretion.

 

You authorize MeMD® to use and publish any comments you choose to share about the MeMD® Service, such as comments shared in the MeMD® Patient Satisfaction Survey and/or via third-party service providers contracted for such purposes, unless specified otherwise. MeMD® will only publish the comments with your first name and the state of requested service.

 

MeMD® does not warrant or validate any information provided by a third party (including, but not limited to, your employer, health plan, or the Providers) even if the information is about the MeMD® Service, whether through advertisements, promotions, communications, or other materials, and does not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy of such information.

 

MeMD® has the right to refuse access to the MeMD® Service to any person, agency, or organization, at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all.

​

DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
 

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS
In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction through calls to our customer care, you and MeMD® each agree to try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice of the dispute as set forth below. If the dispute is not resolved, you and MeMD® agree that the dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of courts of general jurisdiction.

 

Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action. Instead of suing in court, you and MeMD® agree to arbitrate all Disputes (as defined below) on an individual, non-representative, basis. You agree that, by accepting the terms and conditions of this Use Agreement, you and MeMD® are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative action. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.

 

In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. Disputes are instead decided by a neutral third-party arbitrator in a more informal process than in court. In arbitration, there is limited discovery and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms and conditions of the Use Agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys’ fees authorized by law.

 

“Disputes” shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way the MeMD® Service or this Use Agreement, including, but not limited to, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if the claim arises after use of or access or subscription to the MeMD® Service has terminated. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the MeMD® Service brings against MeMD® (including the MeMD® Service), its subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, employees, subcontractors, agents, vendors, suppliers, or licensors; (b) you bring against a third party, such as a Provider, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way the use of or access or subscription to the MeMD® Service or this Use Agreement; or (c) MeMD® brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and MeMD®, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before this Use Agreement or out of a prior Use Agreement with MeMD®; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of your use of or access or subscription to the MeMD® Service or this Use Agreement.

​

DISPUTE NOTICE AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PERIOD.
Before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and MeMD® each agree to first provide to the other a written notice (“Notice of Dispute”), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute to MeMD® should be sent to MeMD’s® registered address and also to (if the registered address is different): MeMD, Inc., 6910 East Chauncey Lane, Suite 220, Phoenix, AZ 85054, Attn: Officers. MeMD® will provide a Notice of Dispute to you at your last known physical address or email address. MeMD® will assign a representative to work with you and try to resolve your Dispute to your satisfaction. You and MeMD® agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or MeMD® may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action.

​

ARBITRATION TERMS, PROCESS, RULES, AND PROCEDURES.
(1) Unless you and MeMD® agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in Maricopa County, Arizona (or such other location to which MeMD® agrees). The arbitration will be governed by either: (a) rules that we mutually agree upon; or (b) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules about filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator’s fees. The JAMS Rules are available on its website at jamsadr.com.  Notwithstanding any JAMS Rule to the contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern the arbitration, we each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.

 

(2) The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to your use of or access or subscription to the MeMD® Service and this Use Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA’s provisions - not state law - govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the “Minimum Standards”), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply. However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow you or MeMD® to arbitrate on a class-wide, representative, or consolidated basis.

 

(3) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND MeMD® AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and MeMD® expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If any portion of this provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.

 

(4) We each are responsible for our respective costs, including our respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses, unless this Use Agreement or applicable law otherwise permits the award of such to MeMD®. We each will pay equally for any filing or case management fees associated with the arbitration and professional fees for the arbitrator’s services.

 

(5) An arbitrator’s award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

 

(6) As an alternative to arbitration, we may resolve Disputes in small claims court in Maricopa County, Arizona (or such other location to which MeMD® agrees).

​

NO TRIAL BY JURY AND NO CLASS ACTION
IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS OR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE MeMD® SERVICE OR THIS USE AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS AN ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM, OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDING, WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTION AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY (1) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (2) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS, INCLUDING JOINING A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERTING A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING.

​

OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
Subject to federal and state law or unless this Use Agreement specifically provides otherwise, your use of and access or subscription to the MeMD® Service and this Use Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state of Arizona, without regard to conflicts of law principles. If either of us waives or doesn’t enforce a requirement under this Use Agreement in an instance, we don’t waive our right to later enforce that requirement. Except as this Use Agreement specifically provides otherwise, if any part of this Use Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Use Agreement remains in full force and effect. This Use Agreement isn’t for the benefit of any third party except MeMD’s® subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, employees, subcontractors, agents, vendors, suppliers, licensors, and predecessors and successors in interest. You can’t assign this Use Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it, unless MeMD® agrees to the assignment. MeMD® can assign this Use Agreement without notice. You cannot in any manner resell the MeMD® Service to another party. This Use Agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreements - you can’t rely on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or service representatives or the Providers. The rights, obligations, and commitments in the Use Agreement that, by their nature, would logically continue beyond the termination of your use of or access or subscription to the MeMD® Service (for example, those relating to billing, payment, dispute resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of your use of and access and subscription to the MeMD® Service and this Use Agreement.

​

REFUND POLICY!!!!!!
Refund Policy
MeMD's Refund Policy
In order to request a visit with a MeMD provider, a valid payment method will need to be on file. The visit fee will be collected once the visit has been completed and the provider has made the chart available to the patient. A transaction may be eligible for a refund up to 60 days from the date of the completed visit. After this period, MeMD will not review or issue refunds for captured payments.

​

MeMD does not guarantee that medication will be prescribed by the treating Medical Provider as they may determine medication is not medically necessary and/or is in violation of MeMD’s Prescription Policy. Refunds for completed visit will not be provided solely on the basis that medication was not prescribed.

​

MeMD may verify patient eligibility received through an employer affiliation at the time of a visit request prior to issuing a refund.




PRESCRIPTION POLICY!!!!!!!
Can you write a prescription?
Yes, our medical & psychiatric providers can send a prescription straight to your local pharmacy, when medically necessary.
MeMD's medical team is made up of board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who are licensed to practice medicine in your state. They can diagnose, treat and prescribe medication when medically necessary. When you request a visit, we’ll ask you for your preferred pharmacy, and even help you to find one that's 24/7.

Medical Prescription Policy
Our medical providers are able to prescribe a wide range of drugs, which can be useful for treating infections, allergies and other minor health concerns.

 

MeMD medical providers do not prescribe elective medications, certain anticonvulsants, narcotic pain relievers, or other drugs listed as controlled substances by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency or regulated under State law. Review the DEA Controlled Substances Schedule if you are interested in a particular prescription and are uncertain if it is listed as a controlled substance.

​

Providers generally do not prescribe more than a 90-day refill within a 6-month period. MeMD consultations treat the majority of common medical conditions, however, a small number of cases require an in-person visit for complete care. Patients, please be informed that MeMD is not a replacement for your primary care physician or annual office check-ups.

A note about antibiotics
Many ailments we treat are caused by infections, some of which are due to viruses or other pathogens, which do not respond to antibiotics. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections and are not always the answer to infections. The more antibiotics are used when not medically necessary, the more likely bacteria become resistant to such medication, making future treatment of bacterial infections more difficult and expensive. As a result, your MeMD provider may present a treatment plan that includes symptom relief for non-bacterial infections, rather than a prescription for antibiotics.

 
Men's & Women's Health Prescription Policy
Through our men’s and women’s health service lines you can consult with a medical provider for common men’s and women’s health conditions including but not limited to erectile dysfunction, hair loss, birth control and STIs. Please note, MeMD is not an online pharmacy. Prescriptions are submitted electronically and are available for purchase and pick-up at your local pharmacy or through a mail order pharmacy.

 

MeMD medical providers do not prescribe certain anticonvulsants, narcotic pain relievers, or other drugs listed as controlled substances by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency or regulated under State law. Review the DEA Controlled Substances Schedule if you are interested in a particular prescription and are uncertain if it is listed as a controlled substance.

 

If a MeMD medical provider determines that tests (e.g., laboratory tests, EKG, other diagnostic tests) are needed prior to prescribing the medication, the patient is responsible for following up in person for the tests.

 

Providers can prescribe up to a year supply of maintenance medications if you can supply proof of your most recent wellness/physical exam (within the year) and upload it to the chart for the provider’s review. If you are unable to supply proof of your most recent wellness/physical exam, the provider can write a short-term prescription of up to 3 months. Please note that prescriptions are written at the medical provider’s discretion – a small number of cases may require an in person visit for complete care.

 
Psychiatry Prescription Policy
Psychiatry Prescription Policy
With MeMD you can consult a psychiatric provider online and receive personalized treatment, including prescriptions when medically necessary. Please note, MeMD is not an online pharmacy. Prescriptions are submitted electronically and are available for purchase and pick-up at your local pharmacy or through a mail-order pharmacy.

 

Please note, refills for prescriptions by a prescribing provider outside of the MeMD network will not be honored. However, if an initial assessment has been completed by a MeMD prescribing provider, and the patient is actively following their medication regimen/treatment plan, the patient can request a medication management visit within the window of the original prescribing period. MeMD psychiatry visits treat the majority of common behavioral health issues, however, a small number of cases require an in-person visit for complete care. If a MeMD psychiatric provider determines that tests (e.g., laboratory tests, EKG, other diagnostic tests) are needed prior to prescribing the medication, the patient is responsible for following up in person for the tests.

 

MeMD providers will not prescribe elective medications, or other drugs listed as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency or regulated under State Law. Review the DEA Controlled Substance Schedule if you are interested in a particular prescription and are uncertain if it is listed as a controlled substance. 

 
Talk Therapy Prescription Policy
MeMD therapists do not prescribe medication but instead provide talk therapy to pinpoint your needs, establish a treatment plan and measure your progress.

Please note
Refunds will not be issued to patients who request visits for mental illnesses or prescription refills that are in violation of the MeMD prescription policy.

​

MeMD is not an online pharmacy; your prescription will be sent to a local participating pharmacy for purchase and pick-up. You may download a copy of the medical provider’s visit summary for your records.






MISSED APPIONTMENT!!!!!!
No Shows, Cancellations, and Late Arrivals Policy
No Shows and Cancellations
Patients must cancel a scheduled session at least 24 hours in advance of the session in order to receive a full refund. If the session is not cancelled before that time, the patient will be responsible for a missed session fee or the fees the patient’s insurer or other payor would have otherwise paid for the scheduled services had they taken place.

Late Arrivals

Refund Policy
Prescription Policy

Missed Appointments
Patients can miss up to 40% of their session time (i.e. arrive late) and nevertheless continue to log on for their scheduled visit. The patient will then have the ability to complete the remaining 60% of their scheduled visit. The session will end at the originally scheduled time.

 

Once the patient has missed more than 40% of their scheduled visit, the clinician will no longer be made available to the patient and the patient will be responsible for a missed session fee or the fees the patient’s insurer or other payor would have otherwise paid for the scheduled services had they taken place.
